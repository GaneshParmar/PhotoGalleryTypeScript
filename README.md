# Photo Gallery TypeScript Project

This is a simple photo gallery project built using TypeScript. It fetches photos from the Unsplash API based on a user's search query and displays them in a gallery format.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `compiledjs/`: Contains the compiled JavaScript files.
- `./`: Contains the TypeScript source files.
- `index.html`: The HTML file for the photo gallery.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GaneshParmar/PhotoGalleryTypeScript.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd PhotoGalleryTypeScript`
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the photo gallery.

## Compilation

The TypeScript files in the `ts/` directory need to be compiled into JavaScript before running the project. The compiled JavaScript files are stored in the `compiledjs/` directory.

To compile the TypeScript files, you can use a TypeScript compiler such as `tsc`. Run the following command in the project directory:

$ tsc

This will compile the TypeScript files and generate the corresponding JavaScript files in the `compiledjs/` directory.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- None (The Fetch API is used for making HTTP requests to the Unsplash API, which is supported by modern browsers).

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to suggest enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
